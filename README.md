# Copy Breadcrumbs Plugin for VSCode

![icon]

This is a fork of [scott blair's copy breadcrumbs plugin][sblair] for visual studio code.

The original plugin worked nicely (thank you Scott Blair) but I forked it because I wanted to:

* examine the plugin's code, but there was not GitHub repo attached to the plugin
* contribute a feature (configurable breadcrumb path separation characters), but... there was no repo to which I could submit pull requests
* contribute some documentation but... you get the idea.

## What does it do?

Sit tight, we're about to enter inception-mode:

If, for example, you were editing this very README file and you wanted to grab the breadcrumb, you would simply open the Command Palette and choose "Copy Breadcrumb".
